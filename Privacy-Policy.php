<p>This practice is required to provide our clients with notice of our privacy practices with respect to protected personal information collected from this website.
<br>
<h3><strong>Consent</strong></h3>
<br>
By using this website, you consent to understanding and accepting the terms listed in this privacy policy.
 We reserve the right to update, amend, or change this Privacy Policy at any time to conform to new laws and regulations or 
 changes in business standards. This privacy policy does not extend to any third party websites that link to or from our website and we are not 
 responsible for any of the content on those websites. Those websites have their own privacy policies and it is recommended that users read through 
 them before providing any information to the website owner.

<strong>
Information Security</strong></h2>
<br>
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and 
transmitted to us in a secure way, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. All forms have 256 bit encryption to securely transmit information.
<br>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 
These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures
to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
<br>
Our privacy policy does not cover content that is transmitted via email to our office. Email does not have the same encryption and security protocols 
and should not be used to transmit sensitive information.
<br>
